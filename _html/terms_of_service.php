                              is free. We do not charge a seller any fee for listing 
                              a certificate, however when the certificate or item 
                              sells, a processing fee is assessed in accordance 
                              with our fee policy. Our fee policy also explains 
                              how and when your account is charged for certain 
                              items and when payment will be made to you. We may 
                              change our fee policy and the fees for our services 
                              from time to time. Our changes to the policy are 
                              effective after we provide you with at least fourteen 
                              (14) days' notice of the changes by posting the 
                              changes on the Site. However, we may choose to temporarily 
                              change our fees for our services for promotional 
                              events (for example, free listing days) and such 
                              changes are effective when we post the temporary 
                              promotional event on the Site and shall be effective 
                              only for business directly related to such promotional

                              is a Venue 3.1</strong><br>
                              GiftCardsToday is an online marketplace connecting 
                              consumers looking to either buy or sell a gift certificate 
                              to a merchant. Discount certificates and percentage-off 
                              certificates are not permitted. The Site acts as 
                              a venue to allow anyone to offer, sell, and buy 
                              a gift certificate issued by retailers and merchants 
                              nationwide. We operate on a fixed price format and 
                              allow our sellers to set the price of their gift 
                              certificate as long as it is no more than the face 
                              value of the certificate less the greater of (i) 
                              3% of face value or (ii) $1.50. We are not involved 
                              in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers 
                              and shall have no liability or responsibility for 
                              any transaction. As a result, we have no control 
                              over the quality of the items advertised, the truth 
                              or accuracy of the listings or the ability of sellers 
                              to sell items. We cannot ensure or guarantee that 
                              a seller will actually complete a transaction. Consequently, 
                              we do not transfer legal ownership of items from 
                              the seller to the buyer, and nothing in this agreement 
                              shall modify the governing provisions of Virginia 
                              Code &sect; 8.2-401(2), under which legal ownership 
                              of an item is transferred upon physical delivery 
                              of the item to the buyer by the seller. <br>
                              3.2 Identity Verification. We use many techniques 
                              to verify the accuracy of the information our users 
                              provide us when they register on the Site. However, 
                              because user verification on the Internet is difficult, 
                              GiftCardsToday cannot and does not confirm each 
                              user's purported identity. Thus, we have established 
                              a user-initiated feedback system to help you evaluate 
                              with whom you are dealing. We also encourage you 
                              to communicate directly with potential trading partners 
                              through the tools available on the Site.<br>
                              3.3 Release. Because we are a venue, in the event 
                              that you have a dispute with one or more users, 
                              you release GiftCardsToday (and our officers, directors, 
                              agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) 
                              from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) 
                              of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected 
                              and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising 
                              out of or in any way connected with such disputes. 
                              If you are a California resident, you waive California 
                              Civil Code &sect;1542, which says: &quot;A general 
                              release does not extend to claims which the creditor 
                              does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at 
                              the time of executing the release, which if known

                                In the event a dispute arises between you and 
                                GiftCardsToday, our goal is to provide you with 
                                a neutral and cost effective means of resolving 
                                the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and GiftCardsToday 
                                agree that any claim or controversy at law or 
                                equity that arises out of this Agreement or our 
                                services (&quot;Claims&quot;) shall be resolved 
                                in accordance with one of the subsections below 
                                or as otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing 
                                by the parties. Before resorting to these alternatives, 
                                we strongly encourage you to first contact us 
                                directly to seek a resolution and we will consider 
                                reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through 
                                alternative dispute resolution procedures, such 
                                as mediation, as an alternative to litigation.

                                16.1 Binding Arbitration. For any Claim (excluding 
                                Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) 
                                where the total amount of the award sought is 
                                less than $10,000, you or GiftCardsToday may 
                                elect to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration 
                                conducted by telephone, on-line and/or based solely 
                                upon written submissions where no in-person appearance 
                                is required. In such cases, the arbitration shall 
                                be administered by the American Arbitration Association 
                                or JAMS in accordance with their applicable rules, 
                                or any other established ADR provider mutually 
                                agreed upon by the parties. Any judgment on the 
                                award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered 
                                in any court having jurisdiction thereof. <br>
                                16.2 Court. Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated 
                                by a court of competent jurisdiction located in 
                                Roanoke City, Virginia or where the defendant 
                                is located (in our case Roanoke City, Virginia, 
                                and in your case your home address or principal 
                                place of business). You and GiftCardsToday agree 
                                to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the 
                                courts located within the City of Roanoke, Virginia.

                                GiftCardsToday will consider use of other alternative 
                                forms of dispute resolution, such as binding arbitration

                                mutually agreed upon by the parties. All Claims 
                                (excluding requests for injunctive or equitable 
                                relief) between the parties must be resolved using 
                                the dispute resolution mechanism that is selected 
                                in accordance with this Section by the first party 
                                to file a Claim. Should either party file an action 
                                contrary to this Section 16, the other party may 
                                recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $1000, 
                                provided that the party seeking the award has 
                                notified the other party in writing of the improperly 
                                filed Claim, and the other party has failed to 
                                withdraw the Claim. </font></li>
